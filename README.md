# Introducing Conver
Conver is an open source personal/home assistant project built entirely in [Python](https://github.com/python/cpython). It uses [Google Speech To Text](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/SpeechRecognition) along with [Google's Text To Speech](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gTTS) functionality to put together this work in progress productivity tool. Conver is extremly useful and has a variety of cool things it can do which you can find here, in the [Features](https://github.com/Codiscite/Conver/blob/master/README.md#features) section.

  2. Download the [Files for Conver](https://github.com/Codiscite/Conver)
  3. Run [setup.py](https://github.com/Codiscite/Conver/blob/master/setup.py)

Steps may be a bit different depending on your operating system but hopefully everything should work the same way. If their are any issues, be sure to contact me via my [email](mailto:spiketheking2@gmail.com).

## Voice Texting
Voice Texting is the newest feature of Conver. It adds the ability to message a contact hands-free and even when your phone isn't close by! It uses the awesome functionality of [Pushbullet](https://www.pushbullet.com/), a service built by a team of superheroes in San Francisco that allows SMS messaging and text management from a computer!

Setting up Voice Texting:
  1. Create a [Pushbullet](https://www.pushbullet.com/) Account.
  2. [Download and Setup Pushbullet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pushbullet.android) on Your Phone!
  3. Change the Text After "|pushbullet_API_Key|=" in [ConverData.txt](https://github.com/Codiscite/Conver/blob/master/ConverData.txt) to be your [Pushbullet API Key](https://www.pushbullet.com/#settings/account) (Scroll down to 'Access Tokens').

And there you are. Voice Texting is super simple to setup and works like a charm! Try it out by saying something like: "text (contact) Hey Bro!" or "conver, text (contact) I'm on my way home."

Currently Voice Texting is only compatible with contacts in the [Contacts.csv](https://github.com/Codiscite/Conver/blob/master/Contacts.csv) file but can be easily added in the format of: "{contact name}, {conact number}".

## About
We hope Conver will be liked and be sure to fork us if you want to help support the development of Conver!
